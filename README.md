## Team name: Boshko and the girls
Natalija Tashkova, Sara Pachemska and Zhaneta Koceva.
(FAMNIT Hackathon 2.0.)

## Few words about us...
We are 2. year Computer Science students that are alywas eager to face challenges.
World problems are those that inspire us and trigger our critical thinking.
Every single of us left a great amount of contribution to this project.
We were happy to share our ideas with all the mentors from the GDSC as well as the mentors from the companies.
All of these connections and networking made this project possible.

## Our project...
### Problem: Lack of financial literacy leading to lack of e-banking opportunities for the elderly.
### Solution: Innovative way of e-banking during shopping executed in a vastly simple way for the users that lack financial literacy.


## Our idea:
E-Banking app that will be monitored from the provider side, requesting users/clients personal information 
to execute a transaction in a secure way with clients approval.

## Normal E-banking: 
Requires the users/consumers to directly use the app.

## Reversed E-banking:
The user does not interact with the app directly, only confirming the transactions.

### What's next?
AI call text to speech OTPs.
